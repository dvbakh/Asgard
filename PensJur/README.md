WhatsApp bot integrated with Google spreadsheet
## How does it work?
The site has a feedback form consisting of name and phone number. It is uploaded to the Google spreadsheet with which this WhatsApp bot is integrated. When a new entry appears in the table, bot uses new data and immediately writes to the person in WhatsApp to find out the question in detail. Technically, it is difficult to call it a bot in the full sense of the word, since it sends a single message.
