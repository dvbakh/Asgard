# SamVSud_Bot
This bot is for the project Sam V Sud, which allows the user to find answers to the five most common questions that are asked to the consultant. It helps to simplify the work of consultants. 
## How does it work?
When you write to the chat, you see buttons with the five most frequent problems. If you have the same one and you want to know how to solve it, you click the button. First, the bot checks the subscription to the group, and then sends a link to the video according to your request. After that everything goes back to the beginning.
